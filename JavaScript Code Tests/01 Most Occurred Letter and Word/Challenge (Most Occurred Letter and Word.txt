Given a string of words as an input

	'word1 word2 word3 word4'

Task is to output the word with the most repeated letters
than any other words of the string. In case two words have
the same number of repeated letters, output -1 as the answer

CASE 1

	Input: 'Hello World'

	Output: 'Hello'

Explaination: Since Hello contains 2 'l's we output it


CASE 2

	Input: 'Preach Tree Too'

	Output: -1

Explaination: Tree contains 2 e's and Two contains 2 o's
Both have same amount of repeats (2) so no word goes at 
the output

CASE 3

	Input: 'YOOOOO CHECK THIS OUT BUDDY'

	Output:'YOOOOO'

Explaination: YOOOOO contains 5 O's and no other word has
a letter repeatence of more than 5 so YOOOOO is given as
the Output
