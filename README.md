# JavaScript Code Tests

The following repository contains my solutions to some of the JavaScript coding challenges that were presented at job tests/interviews.  
Each subfolder in the "JavaScript Code Tests" folder contains the challenge presented (as a .txt file) along with my successful attempt at obtaining the solution (as a .js file).

- The solutions include comments to help you understand it better.

- Incase I refine or refactor a solution, I'll add it in the respective subfolder.  
Both original and new solutions will be present as seperate files.
